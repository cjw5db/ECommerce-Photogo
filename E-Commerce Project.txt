Product or Service: Photogo is a marketplace for photographers.  Photographers are able to post and sell their photos online, where general users are able to view, purchase, and download various sizes of the image directly from the site.  In addition, if a buyer finds that they like a particular photographers skills, then they can reach out to the photographer to hire their services.  The site is meant to be focused on the photographers and their work, which requires thoughtful design for the layout of the webpage and the presentation of images to best showcase each artist.
 
Need in the Marketplace: Currently there is a lack of marketability for photographer’s skills and their products.  There is no current way for them to sell ALL that they have to offer, which includes both their portfolio of personally taken photos and their contractible services.  There of course exist websites to buy photos as well as websites to hire contractible workers, but none that do both.  We think that photogo can be an incredible place to both share images and support some of the most starved artists in our communities.  It is the combined ability of these two different services as well as the focus specifically on photography that will make PhotoGo a successful business.
