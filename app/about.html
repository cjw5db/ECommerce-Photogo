				<h3> Product/Services </h3>
				</br>
					<p> Photogo is a marketplace for photographers.  Photographers are able to post and sell their photos online, where general users are able to view, purchase, and download various sizes of the image directly from the site. In addition, if a buyer finds that they like a particular photographers skills, then they can reach out to the photographer to hire their services.</p> </br>
					<p> PhotoGo makes it easy to advertise and sell for photographers and also gives new artists a platform to post their photos and gain some recognition in the photography business.  The site is meant to be focused on the photographers and their work. </p>
				</br> <h3> Why PhotoGo? </h3> </br>
					<p> Currently there is a lack of marketability for photographerâ€™s skills and their products.  There is no current way for them to sell ALL that they have to offer, which includes both their portfolio of personally taken photos and their contractible services.  There of course exist websites to buy photos as well as websites to hire contractible workers, but none that do both. </p> </br>
					<p> We here at PhotoGo give users an incredible place to both share images and support some of the most starved artists in our communities.  It is the combined ability of these two different services as well as the focus specifically on photography that makes PhotoGo Unique. If you have any questions please visit the Contact Us Page! </p>
